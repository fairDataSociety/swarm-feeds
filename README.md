# Swarm Feeds

The current Feed implementations only let you fetch the latest update and append a new one.

This library gives you more freedom for Swarm Feed reading and manipulation by specifying indices on actions and add additional payload.

For new feed implementations, there are interfaces to implement in order to facilitate the integrations and make interoperability between Feed types.
